1) S3

a) properties of S3:-
    - versioning
    - server access logging
    - static website hosting
    - object level logging
    - tags
    - transfer acceleration
    - events

b) AWS S3 provides eventual consistency for DELETES and PUTS in all region.

c) Read-after-write consistency.
    - Amazon S3 supports read-after-write consistency for new ojbects added to amazon S3 in US standard regions.

d) The file gateway presents a file interface that enables you to store files as objects in Amazon S3 using the industry-standard NFS and SMB file protocals, and access those files iva NFS and SMB from your datacenter or Amazon Ec2, or access those files as objects with the S3 API.

e) All objects by dufault are private. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own seurity credintails, to gran time-limited permission to wonload the objects.

f) True statements:-
    - Amazon s3 does not support object locking for concurrent writers.
    - Any read that is initiated following the receipt of a successful PUT response will return the data written by the PUT.
    - Updates to a single key are atomic.

g) Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates.
    - at least 3,500 put/post/delete and 5,500 get request per second per prefix in a bucket.

h) AWS recommends using multi-part uploads for larger objects.
    -with a single PUT operation, users can upload objects up to 5GB in size.
    - if it exceeds, use multi-part.

i) All objects in S3 are private by default. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a per-signed URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.
    - Anyone who receives the pre-signed URL can then access the object.

j) check logs for unauthorized IP address to S3 bucket can viewed by:-
    - Enabling server access loggin
        - provides detailed records for the request that are made to a bucket.

     - Enabling CloudTrail logging using OPTIONS object
       
k) system metadata and user defined metadata

l)Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests  that are made to a bucket.

m) Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web application that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.
    - If uploading or put is blocked to S3, add configuration is s3 bucket CORS to allow PUT requests from web applition URL.

n) If overwritten s3 bucket, right after that if the object is being requested, user might get any version between cause PUTS and DELETES are eventual consistency.

o) valid URL for accesing the bucktes:-
    - https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key_name
        https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/puppy.png
    - https://s3.Region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/key_name
        https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mybucket/puppy.jpg

p) size of S3:-
    min:- 0 Byte
    max:- 5 terabytes

q)for logs not frequently accessed can be sent to STANDARD-IA and can be moved to Glacier later.

r) When versioning is enabled on S3 bucket and a new version is added to an existing object, remember that older version still remains and AWS charges same price for old version and new versions.
        - eg:- 1 GB uplaoded on day 1 remains in S3 for all 25 days, 5GB uploaded on day 15 will be in S3 for only 11 days.

s) When user delete an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, all versions remain in the bucket and Amazon S3 creates a delete marker for the object. To undelete an object, one must delete the delete marker.

t) DELETE API call on the object does not delete the actual object, but places delete market on the object.

u) How to send notificaiton to a group of people who do not have AWS IAM account?
    - Use S3 event notification and configure Lambda function which sends email using AWS SES non-sandboc.
    - Use S3 event notification and configure SNS which sends email to subsribed email addresses.

v) Latency of upload and download fo videos file can be solved by:-
    - using CloudFront for imporoving the performance on website by caching static files.
    - Enabling Transfer Acceleration feature on S3 bucket which uses AWS edge locations to improve upload and download speeds.

w) Cross region replication requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
