1. some of the valid integration sources for API Gateway:-
    - public facing HTTP-based endpoints outside AWS network
    - Lambda functions from another account
    - VPC Link


2. Use VPC link to integrate on-premises backend solutions through DirectConnect and private VPC.


3. To prevent API from being overwhelmed by too many requests. Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token count for a request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions against all API in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size.


4. When API receives large number of requests and overloading backend system causing performance bootlenecks and eventyally causing delays and failures in serving the request,
    - enabling throttling and contol the number of requests per second
    - enabling API caching to server frequently requested data from API cache 
    can be done.


5. Amazon API Gateway Usage plans now support method level throttling.


6. Controlling Access to an API in API Gateway:-
    - Resource policies
    - Standard AWS IAM roles and policies
    - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
    - Lambda authorizers
    - Amazon Cognito user pools
    - Client-side SSL certificates
    - Usage plans


7. Protection from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks is provided default by AWS to protect the backend systems, in AWS API Gateway.

8. Following are the settings and actions when enabling/disabling API caching for API Gateway:-
    -flush entire cache
    -cache capacity
    -encrypt cache data

9. Enabling access logging
