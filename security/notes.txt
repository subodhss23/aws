 PART ---- 1
============================================================
- Fundramental of cloud security
    - shared responsibilty model
- Compliance
- Account management


1. Shared responsibilty model
2. Compliance

- Principle of least priviledge
- use access policy
- json document
    - effect
    - action
    - resources
- MFA (Multi facto authentication)
- Strong password
- Roles and groups to assign permisssions
- Monitoring using amazon cloudwatch and aws cloudtrail

****************************************************************
1. creating new user
2. avoding using root account
3. creating group, adding user and giving permission with policy
    - how to scale account creation with right resource, right permission?
        --> aws organization
            - automate  account creation and management
            - create groups of account to meet business needs
            - govern access to aws service resources region by policy
            - set up single  payment method for all aws account with consolidation billing
            - share resources across accounts

4. creating new orgization
5. keep master account free of any operational aws resources
6. use aws cloudtrail
- apply least priviledge practice
-assign policies to organizational units
7. IAM roles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 AWS IAM
=======================================
- Manage  IAM users and their access
- manage IAM roles and their permissions
- manage federated users and their permissions
    - aws console SSO or API federation

*** Different policy
    - aws managed policy
    - customer managed policy
    - inline policy
    ( recomendation is to use managed policy instead of inline policy)

--->>>AWS Single Sign-On(SSO)
    - helps centrally manage sso access to multiple aws accounts and business application.
    - login once and get access to multiple application or accounts is an exaple of sso.

-->> Amazon cloud directory
    - can create directory for varitey of use cases, such as:-
        - organizational charts
        - course catalogs,
        - device registeries
    - gives flexibility to create directories with hierarchies that span multiple dimensions

================================================================================================
** Directory services
    - cognito (user pool) stores data of and about the users
    - cognito identity

1. Network isolation
    - Endpoint allow secure HTTP access (HTTPS)
    a) VPC
    - VPC can be connected with IPSec tunnel and AWS direct connect  to on premise infrastructure
        -NACLs are for  public subnet
            - list that contains whitelist and blacklist ips
            - are stateless(must have inbound and outbound rules)
    - Security groups act as firewall for Amazon EC2 instances, controlling traffic at the instance level.
        - they are stateful (allow inbound allows outbound, and vice versa)
    
    b) VPC endpoint and private links
        - how to secure traffic between two VPCs?
        - do not leave aws infrastructure 
        - two types of VPC endpoints:-
            - Gateway endpoint
            - Interface endpoint

    c) Route tables
        - when provisioning VPC it comes with route table, like a home router(analogy)
        - must associate a subnet with an actual route table.            

    - what is flow logs in VPC? What can it monitor? ********

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Directive controls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    - auditing 
    
    a) AWS cloudtrail
        - log, continously monitor, retain account activity related to account across aws infrastructure.

    b) AWS config
        - assess, audit, and evaluate the configuration of aws resources.
        - continously monitors and records aws resource configurations.
        - this enables to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and
            operational troubleshooting.
        - configuration management
        - history, notification proactively
        
    c) Amazon Inspector
        - exposure of ec2 instances, vulnerabiliites
        - three parts:-
            - network configuration reachability
            - amazon agent
            - security assessment service
            
    d) AWS Trusted Advisor
        - this service assists in provisioning aws resources using best practices.
        - and then produces a report under five different categories:-
            - cost optimization
            - performance
            - security
            - fault tolerance
            - service limits
        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Monitor
    
    a) CloudWatch and cloudwatch logs
        - alarm --> SNS topic or auto scaling policy
        - mointor to chaing an ec2 security group
        - can be used to:-
            - monitor
            - store
            - access
        
        - usecase is to collect and store application logs, and server operation system logs.
        - another usecase is to use Cloudtrail to capture API activities and send them to
            cloudwatch logs.
        - also can log route 53 DNS queries into cloudwatch logs.
        - cloudwatch logs can be used to retain and archive log data in S3
        - cloudwatch logs insights can be used to interactively search and analyze the data.
       
    
    b) Monitoring guard duty and sercurity hub
        - Amazon GuardDuty
            - a threat-detection service that is continuously monitors for malicious or
                unauthorized behavior to help you protect your AWS accounts and resources.
            - uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to 
                identify and prioritize potential threats.
        
            - it analyze multiple aws data resources, such as
                - aws cloudtrail,amazon vpc flow logs, DNS logs
                - guardduty and aws cloudwatch events or current event management sytem can be 
                    integrated to alert security team.
            
            - Amazon guardDuty provides three severity levels - 
                - low, medium, and high  


        --> AWS Security hub 
            - single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security alerts and findings
                from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie
                , Aws partner solutions
            - visually summarized on itegrated dashboards witha ctionable graphs and tables.

PART 3                                     |
--------------------------------------------
- Data protection - (Encryption)


1. Data types
    - object    -> S3, S3 glacier
    - database  --> RDS, timestream, quantum ladger database, neptune
    - amazon ec2 data  --> EBS, EFS
    - data warehouse   --> redshift, athena
    - data lake     -->lake formation
    - transfer of data --> snowball, snowmobile
    
2. Encryption in transit
    - define requirements for data protection in transit
    - authenticate network communications (by using TLS or using IPSec)
    - encryption on app can be done on web app or on load balancer
    - ACM (Aws certificate manager) handles creation and management of public SSL and TLS
        certificates.
    
3. Encryption at Rest
    - KMS 
    - CMK (managed by user) (lives in users aws account)
    - aws managed ( lives in users aws account)
    - aws owned ( lives outside users aws account)
    
    - AWS CloudHSM 
    
4. Database encryption
    - RDS -> each DB engine has its own process of implementation of SSL
        - while creating the instance the encryption needs to be enabled
    - data encrypted at rest includes underlying storage for a DB instance, its automated backups,
        read replicas, and snapshots.
    - to manage the key AWS KMS is used
    - what if NoSQL?
        - all user data stored in DynamoDB tables are encrypted by default.
        - server side encryption is enabled and cannot be diabled
       

***************     S3
- how to secure s3?
    - allow access only to authorized parties
    - disable public access unless needed
    - consider encryption
    - no extra charge for default encryption but will be charge for 
        encryption keys
    
    
- Amazon Macie
    - manged option of securing S3 buckets.
    - use machine learning
    - it checks:-
        - exposure of data
        - insider threats
        - targeted attacks
        

- EBS Encryption
    - EBS -> block storage for ec2 instance(like virtual hard drive)
    - typical use case:-
        - big data analytics
        - relational and nosql database
        - stream and log processing applications
        - data warehousing applications

    - has a feature to take snapshot to backup, to store on S3
    - it uses aws key managemenet services
    - encryption happens in server
    - can be encrypted or unencrypted
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 4
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) protecting computer resources
    -EC2
        -aws will be responsible for hypervisor and EC2 instance isolation
        -to protech ec2 instance, os is users responsibilty
        - user network groups, use network ACLs as a scondary control for denying a specific subnet
        - only should install necessary and well known packages.
        - ssh key should be secured
        - control the API access coming from EC2 instances
        - user IAM roles for API permissions
        - apply change management and configuration management to monitor and control Amazon EC2
            configurations.
        - regularly scan and install missing patch for your instances.
        - Apply security monitoring and auditing for EC2 resources and your accounts.
            - cloudtrail for api
        
        - Docker services
            - Amazon Elastic container service(ECS)
            - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
            - AWS Fargate
            - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        
        - AWS Lambda
            - Automatically runs code without requiring you to provision or manage servers.
            - AWS manages:-
                - Underlying infrastructure and foundation services
                - operating system
                - application platform
            - Users are reponsible for:-
                - sercurity of your code
                - storrage and accessibility of sensitive data
                - IAM to the Lambda service and within your function
                - can use cloudwatch and cloudtrail to monitor and watch lambda function
                - track configuration using AWS config

2) protecting endpoints
    EC2 --> 
        - Elastic Load Balancer
            - Application load balancer(layer 7)
            - Network load balancer(layer 4)
                - round robin
        - Amazon API gateway
            - protecting backend by not opening whole interface to the world
            - use SigV4 to authorize user for api gateway
        - AWS WAF
            - web application firewall that helps protect the web app from common web exploits that
                could affect app availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
            
3) Managing Secrets
    - sercrets are password, api keys or even arbitary text
    - rotate secret frequently 
    - secrets need to be encrypted in rest and in transit
    - never to log secrets in system logs and application logs
    - AWS secrets manager is aws service makes easier to manage secrets.
   
    NOTE:- AWS Secrets Manager allows you to handle access to secrets without the need to store 
            them locally on any intance, server, or in any container.

4) Well architected tool
