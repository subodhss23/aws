 PART ---- 1
============================================================
- Fundramental of cloud security
    - shared responsibilty model
- Compliance
- Account management


1. Shared responsibilty model
2. Compliance

- Principle of least priviledge
- use access policy
- json document
    - effect
    - action
    - resources
- MFA (Multi facto authentication)
- Strong password
- Roles and groups to assign permisssions
- Monitoring using amazon cloudwatch and aws cloudtrail

****************************************************************
1. creating new user
2. avoding using root account
3. creating group, adding user and giving permission with policy
    - how to scale account creation with right resource, right permission?
        --> aws organization
            - automate  account creation and management
            - create groups of account to meet business needs
            - govern access to aws service resources region by policy
            - set up single  payment method for all aws account with consolidation billing
            - share resources across accounts

4. creating new orgization
5. keep master account free of any operational aws resources
6. use aws cloudtrail
- apply least priviledge practice
-assign policies to organizational units
7. IAM roles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 AWS IAM
=======================================
- Manage  IAM users and their access
- manage IAM roles and their permissions
- manage federated users and their permissions
    - aws console SSO or API federation

*** Different policy
    - aws managed policy
    - customer managed policy
    - inline policy
    ( recomendation is to use managed policy instead of inline policy)

--->>>AWS Single Sign-On(SSO)
    - helps centrally manage sso access to multiple aws accounts and business application.
    - login once and get access to multiple application or accounts is an exaple of sso.

-->> Amazon cloud directory
    - can create directory for varitey of use cases, such as:-
        - organizational charts
        - course catalogs,
        - device registeries
    - gives flexibility to create directories with hierarchies that span multiple dimensions

================================================================================================
** Directory services
    - cognito (user pool) stores data of and about the users
    - cognito identity

1. Network isolation
    - Endpoint allow secure HTTP access (HTTPS)
    a) VPC
    - VPC can be connected with IPSec tunnel and AWS direct connect  to on premise infrastructure
        -NACLs are for  public subnet
            - list that contains whitelist and blacklist ips
            - are stateless(must have inbound and outbound rules)
    - Security groups act as firewall for Amazon EC2 instances, controlling traffic at the instance level.
        - they are stateful (allow inbound allows outbound, and vice versa)
    
    b) VPC endpoint and private links
        - how to secure traffic between two VPCs?
        - do not leave aws infrastructure 
        - two types of VPC endpoints:-
            - Gateway endpoint
            - Interface endpoint

    c) Route tables
        - when provisioning VPC it comes with route table, like a home router(analogy)
        - must associate a subnet with an actual route table.            

    - what is flow logs in VPC? What can it monitor? ********

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Directive controls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    - auditing 
    
    a) AWS cloudtrail
        - log, continously monitor, retain account activity related to account across aws infrastructure.

    b) AWS config
        - assess, audit, and evaluate the configuration of aws resources.
        - continously monitors and records aws resource configurations.
        - this enables to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and
            operational troubleshooting.
        - configuration management
        - history, notification proactively
        
    c) Amazon Inspector
        - exposure of ec2 instances, vulnerabiliites
        - three parts:-
            - network configuration reachability
            - amazon agent
            - security assessment service
            
    d) AWS Trusted Advisor
        - this service assists in provisioning aws resources using best practices.
        - and then produces a report under five different categories:-
            - cost optimization
            - performance
            - security
            - fault tolerance
            - service limits
        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Monitor
    
    a) CloudWatch and cloudwatch logs
        - alarm --> SNS topic or auto scaling policy
        - mointor to chaing an ec2 security group
        - can be used to:-
            - monitor
            - store
            - access
        
        - usecase is to collect and store application logs, and server operation system logs.
        - another usecase is to use Cloudtrail to capture API activities and send them to
            cloudwatch logs.
        - also can log route 53 DNS queries into cloudwatch logs.
        - cloudwatch logs can be used to retain and archive log data in S3
        - cloudwatch logs insights can be used to interactively search and analyze the data.
       
    
    b) Monitoring guard duty and sercurity hub
        - Amazon GuardDuty
            - a threat-detection service that is continuously monitors for malicious or
                unauthorized behavior to help you protect your AWS accounts and resources.
            - uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to 
                identify and prioritize potential threats.
        
            - it analyze multiple aws data resources, such as
                - aws cloudtrail,amazon vpc flow logs, DNS logs
                - guardduty and aws cloudwatch events or current event management sytem can be 
                    integrated to alert security team.
            
            - Amazon guardDuty provides three severity levels - 
                - low, medium, and high  


        --> AWS Security hub 
            - single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security alerts and findings
                from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie
                , Aws partner solutions
            - visually summarized on itegrated dashboards witha ctionable graphs and tables.
