 PART ---- 1
============================================================
- Fundramental of cloud security
    - shared responsibilty model
- Compliance
- Account management


1. Shared responsibilty model
2. Compliance

- Principle of least priviledge
- use access policy
- json document
    - effect
    - action
    - resources
- MFA (Multi facto authentication)
- Strong password
- Roles and groups to assign permisssions
- Monitoring using amazon cloudwatch and aws cloudtrail

****************************************************************
1. creating new user
2. avoding using root account
3. creating group, adding user and giving permission with policy
    - how to scale account creation with right resource, right permission?
        --> aws organization
            - automate  account creation and management
            - create groups of account to meet business needs
            - govern access to aws service resources region by policy
            - set up single  payment method for all aws account with consolidation billing
            - share resources across accounts

4. creating new orgization
5. keep master account free of any operational aws resources
6. use aws cloudtrail
- apply least priviledge practice
-assign policies to organizational units
7. IAM roles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 AWS IAM
=======================================
- Manage  IAM users and their access
- manage IAM roles and their permissions
- manage federated users and their permissions
    - aws console SSO or API federation

*** Different policy
    - aws managed policy
    - customer managed policy
    - inline policy
    ( recomendation is to use managed policy instead of inline policy)

--->>>AWS Single Sign-On(SSO)
    - helps centrally manage sso access to multiple aws accounts and business application.
    - login once and get access to multiple application or accounts is an exaple of sso.

-->> Amazon cloud directory
    - can create directory for varitey of use cases, such as:-
        - organizational charts
        - course catalogs,
        - device registeries
    - gives flexibility to create directories with hierarchies that span multiple dimensions

================================================================================================
** Directory services
    - cognito (user pool) stores data of and about the users
    - cognito identity

1. Network isolation
    - Endpoint allow secure HTTP access (HTTPS)
    a) VPC
    - VPC can be connected with IPSec tunnel and AWS direct connect  to on premise infrastructure
        -NACLs are for  public subnet
            - list that contains whitelist and blacklist ips
            - are stateless(must have inbound and outbound rules)
    - Security groups act as firewall for Amazon EC2 instances, controlling traffic at the instance level.
        - they are stateful (allow inbound allows outbound, and vice versa)
    
    b) VPC endpoint and private links
        - how to secure traffic between two VPCs?
