        
            MIGRATION
=========================================================

what is migration?
    - process of moving data, application, or other business elements to cloud computing env.
    

- Five phase approach:-
    - Migration preparation and business planning
    - Portfolio discovery and planning
    - Designing, migration, and validating application (phase 3 & 4)
    - operate

- Cloud Adoption Framework - Hybrid Environments
    - business prespectives look at business, people and governance
    - technical prespectives focus on platform, security, and operations.
    

- Six migration strategies:-
    - Rehost
    - Replatform
    - Repurchase
    - Refactor
    - Retire
    - Retain
    
    
    1. Rehost
        - lift and shift
        - pick up and move your app or env to the cloud
        - like forklifting
        - moving to cloud and rearchitecting later once team is comfortable with tech

    2. Replatform
        - gaining some optimization while migrating
        - lift, thiker, and shift
        - just changing small parts, for eg:- cloud db engine,
    
    3. Repurchase
        - making descision to move to different product or licenscing model
        - eg: moving from commercial license to enterprise, or vice versa
        
    4. Refactor
        - refactor or rearchitect
        - driven to add features, scale, or perfomace that would be difficult to achieve in current env.
        - can be expensive cause of hours spend, often yeilds best results
        - taking full advantage of services that the cloud offers.
    
    5. Retire
        - removin legacy technolgy, clean up and reduce assests.
        
    6. Retain
        - retain as is.

PART 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Scalability
    
    a. Scaling constraint
        - app cannot support downtime it would take while changing the underlying architecture
        - manage caches and queues
        - offloading unnecessary work form unscalable servers
        - stale data was life-cycled off of the server to conserve storage
                

    b. Session data managemenet
        - what if there is resources that technically can scale but don't wanna lose session data 
            in the proces?
                - store session data off the instance.
                - using off-server session storage
    
    c. Major scaling methodologies
        - horizontal and vertical scaling
           * horizontal scaling
                - adding more resources and distribute accross them
                - the benefit is it incurs no downtime for orignial resources
                - as load continue to grow we can add more and more resources
                - as the load goes down we can scale back to the orginal number.

            * vertical scaling
                - maintain same local resources but making the resource more capable.
                - adding more memory, storage, compute power
                - limitation, some downtime,
                - you cannot scale down when you scale up


2. High Availability

    - building in such a way that allows for increased uptime.
    - designing for high availability is always a good practice.
    - it is easier in cloud to achieve this
    - avoid single point of failure
    - build multiple instance, or app, 
    - utilize way to distribute traffic and requests across multiple endpoints or nodes
    - load balancing helps a lot here
    - fault tolerance with scalibility
    - monitor your environments
    - automate recovery 


3. Considerations with Migrating DB vs Applications
    
        - size, schema, types of tables, engine-specific limitations
        - platform review and considerations
        - key parameters of new environment
        - can app afford downtime? If yes, how long?
        - data migration - now or later?
        - planning talent/expert          
        - managing time


4. Aws server migration services.

        - SMS (aws service)
            - enables an easier transfer of your virtual resoures directly into your aws cloud env.
            - SMS is agentless service, makes easier and faster to migrate up to thousands of
                on-premise workloads on AWS.
            - requirements:-
                - The service is currently only available for VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, and
                    Azure virtual machines.
                
                
5. AWS migration hub
    - allows to choose the aws and partner migration tools that best fit your needs
    - provide single placer for you to track the progress of the applications you are migrating.

6. Application discover service
    - 2 ways 
        - performing disovery and collecting data about on-premises servers; agentless and agent-based.
        a. Agentless discovery
            - works with VMware vCenter
            - agentless discovery virtual appliance
            - discovery connector collects configuration information about the servers, like hostnames, ip addresses, mac address, disc resource allocations.
            - discovery connector also collects metrics about the VMs.
            - these data point will be extremly useful, if using replatform approach.
            - cannot look inside vm for detail.

        b. Agent-based discovery
            - agent will collect static configuration data
            - will record detailed time-series system performance information, inbound and outbound network connections,and process that are running.
            - these data can be export to perform an analysis and to identify network connections between servers for grouping servers as applications.
            - the application discovery service is integrated with our AWS migration hub, which helps to create a single pane of glass view into migration process.
            - after the service has performed its discovery, user will be able to view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and then user the migration hub to track the migration status of each application.
        - data can be exported to amazon athena and amazon quicksight

- aws discovery service helps user to obtain a snapshot of current state of you data center servers,and the data collect helps to create a cost-optimized migration plan based on unique business requiremenets.
