what is migration?
    - process of moving data, application, or other business elements to cloud computing env.
    

- Five phase approach:-
    - Migration preparation and business planning
    - Portfolio discovery and planning
    - Designing, migration, and validating application (phase 3 & 4)
    - operate

- Cloud Adoption Framework - Hybrid Environments
    - business prespectives look at business, people and governance
    - technical prespectives focus on platform, security, and operations.
    

- Six migration strategies:-
    - Rehost
    - Replatform
    - Repurchase
    - Refactor
    - Retire
    - Retain
    
    
    1. Rehost
        - lift and shift
        - pick up and move your app or env to the cloud
        - like forklifting
        - moving to cloud and rearchitecting later once team is comfortable with tech

    2. Replatform
        - gaining some optimization while migrating
        - lift, thiker, and shift
        - just changing small parts, for eg:- cloud db engine,
    
    3. Repurchase
        - making descision to move to different product or licenscing model
        - eg: moving from commercial license to enterprise, or vice versa
        
    4. Refactor
        - refactor or rearchitect
        - driven to add features, scale, or perfomace that would be difficult to achieve in current env.
        - can be expensive cause of hours spend, often yeilds best results
        - taking full advantage of services that the cloud offers.
    
    5. Retire
        - removin legacy technolgy, clean up and reduce assests.
        
    6. Retain
        - retain as is.
