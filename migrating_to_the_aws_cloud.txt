        
            MIGRATION
=========================================================

what is migration?
    - process of moving data, application, or other business elements to cloud computing env.
    

- Five phase approach:-
    - Migration preparation and business planning
    - Portfolio discovery and planning
    - Designing, migration, and validating application (phase 3 & 4)
    - operate

- Cloud Adoption Framework - Hybrid Environments
    - business prespectives look at business, people and governance
    - technical prespectives focus on platform, security, and operations.
    

- Six migration strategies:-
    - Rehost
    - Replatform
    - Repurchase
    - Refactor
    - Retire
    - Retain
    
    
    1. Rehost
        - lift and shift
        - pick up and move your app or env to the cloud
        - like forklifting
        - moving to cloud and rearchitecting later once team is comfortable with tech

    2. Replatform
        - gaining some optimization while migrating
        - lift, thiker, and shift
        - just changing small parts, for eg:- cloud db engine,
    
    3. Repurchase
        - making descision to move to different product or licenscing model
        - eg: moving from commercial license to enterprise, or vice versa
        
    4. Refactor
        - refactor or rearchitect
        - driven to add features, scale, or perfomace that would be difficult to achieve in current env.
        - can be expensive cause of hours spend, often yeilds best results
        - taking full advantage of services that the cloud offers.
    
    5. Retire
        - removin legacy technolgy, clean up and reduce assests.
        
    6. Retain
        - retain as is.

PART 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Scalability
    
    a. Scaling constraint
        - app cannot support downtime it would take while changing the underlying architecture
        - manage caches and queues
        - offloading unnecessary work form unscalable servers
        - stale data was life-cycled off of the server to conserve storage
                

    b. Session data managemenet
        - what if there is resources that technically can scale but don't wanna lose session data 
            in the proces?
                - store session data off the instance.
                - using off-server session storage
    
    c. Major scaling methodologies
        - horizontal and vertical scaling
           * horizontal scaling
                - adding more resources and distribute accross them
                - the benefit is it incurs no downtime for orignial resources
                - as load continue to grow we can add more and more resources
                - as the load goes down we can scale back to the orginal number.

            * vertical scaling
                - maintain same local resources but making the resource more capable.
                - adding more memory, storage, compute power
                - limitation, some downtime,
                - you cannot scale down when you scale up


2. High Availability

    - building in such a way that allows for increased uptime.
    - designing for high availability is always a good practice.
    - it is easier in cloud to achieve this
    - avoid single point of failure
    - build multiple instance, or app, 
    - utilize way to distribute traffic and requests across multiple endpoints or nodes
    - load balancing helps a lot here
    - fault tolerance with scalibility
    - monitor your environments
    - automate recovery 


3. Considerations with Migrating DB vs Applications
    
        - size, schema, types of tables, engine-specific limitations
        - platform review and considerations
        - key parameters of new environment
        - can app afford downtime? If yes, how long?
        - data migration - now or later?
        - planning talent/expert          
        - managing time


4. Aws server migration services.

        - SMS (aws service)
            - enables an easier transfer of your virtual resoures directly into your aws cloud env.
            - SMS is agentless service, makes easier and faster to migrate up to thousands of
                on-premise workloads on AWS.
            - requirements:-
                - The service is currently only available for VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, and
                    Azure virtual machines.
                
                
5. AWS migration hub
    - allows to choose the aws and partner migration tools that best fit your needs
    - provide single placer for you to track the progress of the applications you are migrating.

6. Application discover service
    - 2 ways 
        - performing disovery and collecting data about on-premises servers; agentless and agent-based.
        a. Agentless discovery
            - works with VMware vCenter
            - agentless discovery virtual appliance
            - discovery connector collects configuration information about the servers, like hostnames, ip addresses, mac address, disc resource allocations.
            - discovery connector also collects metrics about the VMs.
            - these data point will be extremly useful, if using replatform approach.
            - cannot look inside vm for detail.

        b. Agent-based discovery
            - agent will collect static configuration data
            - will record detailed time-series system performance information, inbound and outbound network connections,and process that are running.
            - these data can be export to perform an analysis and to identify network connections between servers for grouping servers as applications.
            - the application discovery service is integrated with our AWS migration hub, which helps to create a single pane of glass view into migration process.
            - after the service has performed its discovery, user will be able to view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and then user the migration hub to track the migration status of each application.
        - data can be exported to amazon athena and amazon quicksight

- aws discovery service helps user to obtain a snapshot of current state of you data center servers,and the data collect helps to create a cost-optimized migration plan based on unique business requiremenets.

    (using IPsec tunnels and transport layer security or TLS)
- set up automated tools to identify other issues.
- encryption data at rest
- securing data use
- use a least-privilege access model.


7. Three of the most commonly used storage services:-
    a) Amazon elastic block store
        - like hard drive
        - can change dynamically volume attached to an instance.
    b) Amazon elastic file system 
        - can be mounted to multiple EC2 instance at the same time
        - shared file system for multiple servers
        - it's just a shared file system
        - it can be mounted to by on premise servers.
    c) simple storage service (S3)
        - object storage system
        - simplicity focuses on simplicity and robustness
        - object and metadata

    
- AWS snowball and aws snowmobile

8) AWS storage gateway
    - utilizes a VM image in on-prem environment that securely connects to the gateway endpoint within AWS. This allows to connect local storage resources to the AWS cloud and enables you to add availability, fault tolerance, and scalability to your storage mechanisms.
    AWS storage gateway options:-
        - File-based
        - Volume-based
        - Tape-based

9) File Gateway
    - file based solution supports a file interface into S3 and it enables you to store you to store and retrive objects in S3 
    - enables to store and retrive objects in S3 using industry-standard file protocals such as NFS,network file system and SMB Server Message Block

10) volume gateway
    - provides cloud back storage volumes that can be mount as iSCSI devices from on-premises application servers.
    - 2 config options:-
        - cached volumes
            - store data in s3 and retian a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally.
        
        - stored volumes
            - low-latency access to the entire dataset, stored localley and snapshots can be made from the on-prem storage.

11) Tape Gateway
    - durably archive backup data into AWS.
    - provides virtual tape infrastructure that scales seamlessly wih business needs and eliminates the operational burden of provisioning, scaling, and maintaining a physical tape infrastructure.
    

12) Data Sync
    - data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving and replicating databetween on-prem storage systems and AWS storage services over the internet or AWS Direct Connect.
    - supports sync between NFS to Amazon EFS or S3



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Database migration service

- to and from same to same, one to another data platfroms
- provides database schema tool
- to use this service, one endpoint must always be located in an AWS service.
- migration from one on-premises to anther on-premises database is not supported.


- Storage Schema conversion tool


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13) AWS Direct connect and route 53
    
    -VPN over the internet

14) AWS system manager and aws cloud formation
    - cloud formation 
        - run whole environment with template within few minutes

    - aws system manager 
        - manage system, it gives path into the servers that are running that enables you to run commands, schedul updates, manage various other tasks from a single point
        -eg:- run a command on a fleet of servers
        - allows to manage not only aws servers but also on premises servers.
        - it uses an agent, SSM agenet or systems manager agent


15) Overview an TCO Logic(Total cost of ownership)
    - TCO Logic :- provide insight into what you currently have, and give you options into what you may want to utilize, in AWS.
        - can be done as s pre-migration step, or as an ongoing analysis to ensure that you are ruunnig each application in the best place, with the right software, even as your environment and price change.

16) Cloud Endure
    - fine tuned machine that enables a much easier end-to-end migration into AWS.
    - simplifies, expedites, and automates large-scale migrations from physical, virtual, and cloud-based infrasrtucture to AWS.
